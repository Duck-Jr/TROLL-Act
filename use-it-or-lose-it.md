"Use it or Lose it"
=====

Any entity who acquires an intellectual asset from someone else should be 
required to use it or license it to someone else to use within a certain 
time after they got it. If they don't, they will have to find someone to 
transfer/sell the asset to. If an intellectual asset is abused (enforced 
in an agressive manner), it may be confiscated by the U.S. government.

(Patent trolls always using patents that they got from other companies.)
